# Cryptopals Challenge Solutions

These are my solutions to the cryptopals challenges. Some of the challenges I found from other repo's were incorrect or weren't following the intended answer (eg. Using extrenal libraries instead of coding by hand).

For this reason I have uploaded my answers. Don't know if they are all 100% correct as there is no official answers but they seem to work as intended and are here in-case someone else wants to double check their work!

Some of the challenges are easy with one or two line implementations while others can be gnarly and unexpected(looking at you set 1 challenge 7).

# TODO
Maybe at somepoint I'll take some of these challenges and expand them into their own repo's for cool little projects
